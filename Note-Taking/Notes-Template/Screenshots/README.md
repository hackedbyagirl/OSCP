# Decription
I use this folder to store all the screenshots I take during a Penetration Test or OSCP Lab Practice. 

I make sure that I do the following:
- explicitly name images to correlate with the tool/finding/ip-address
- Immediately edit what I need to be highlighted/sanitized/commented in the screenshot to ensure a quicker flow when writing a report and ensure I don't forget what the screenshot is showing

# Post Exploitation Tools, Setup, and Usage

## Linux

### Linux Smart Enumeration
Description: Intended to be executed locally on a Linux box to enumerate basic system info and search for common privilege escalation vectors such as world writable files, misconfigurations, clear-text passwords and applicable exploits.

```bash
# wget
wget "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/raw/master/lse.sh" -O lse.sh;chmod 700 lse.sh

# curl
curl "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/raw/master/lse.sh" -Lo lse.sh;chmod 700 lse.sh

# usage
./lse.sh [options]
```
### Linux Exploit Suggester
Description: Linux privilege escalation auditing tool

```bash
# wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh

# usage
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```
### linuxprivcheacker
Description: Linux Privilege Escalation Check Script - used on python2 

```bash
# wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker/master/linuxprivchecker.py

# usage
python linuxprivchecker.py -w -o linuxprivchecker.log
```
## Windows 
*needs to be better updated and understood by me lol*

### PowerUp
Description: Aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on mis-configurations.

Install: Copy the batch file from your attacker machine to a user writeable directory on the victim machine (typically the current users folder, or the "public" user folder will be writeable).

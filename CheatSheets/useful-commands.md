This is just to track useful commands that I have used but haven't structured my folders yet in a way to sort them. So this will be random lol

```bash
# Escaping rbash restrictions when you cant move direcetiories or anything
# Escaping through editors vi or vim
vim

# In open vim editor
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

# You can also escape by using a reverse shell - More info at link below
